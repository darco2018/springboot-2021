       /* ----------------------- ACTUATOR INFO ------------------------------------------------
       Actuator endpoints let you monitor and interact with your application. Spring Boot includes a number of built-in endpoints and lets you add your own.
        /actuator/<endpoint> eg /actuator/health
        Some endpoints: health, mappings, beans, info, configprops, env, httptrace, loggers, metrics, sessions, shutdown, flyway

        EXPOSE ENDPOINTS:
        - management.endpoints.enabled-by-default=true or set to false & management.endpoint.<>.enabled=true
        - The Actuator HTTP Trace and Auditing features are not enabled by default anymore. For web apps add
           management.endpoints.web.exposure.include=*  You can also use ........exclude=health,info
        - CORS disabled by default
          management.endpoints.web.cors.allowed-origins=https://example.com
          management.endpoints.web.cors.allowed-methods=GET,POST
         - Docs more info on
           - how to secure actuator when in production
           - how to add custom endpoints & exposed data
           - how to interact by HTTP get, post, delete
       * Actuator can be used with another dep: HAL explorer

		HAL explorer opens at localhost:8080 & redirects to http://localhost:8080/explorer/index.html#/
		Spring Data REST HAL Browser is deprecated! Prefer the HAL Explorer (artifactId: spring-data-rest-hal-explorer)!

		Including HAL within our REST API makes it much more explorable to users as well as being essentially self-documenting.
        It works by returning data in JSON format which outlines relevant information about the API.
        The HAL browser provides an in-browser GUI to traverse your REST API.*/

			2. Settings: turn on: Build project automatically (only works when not running or debugging)
			3. REGISTRY: compiler.automake.allow.when.app.running=true (may eventually delete some classes that are required by the application.)

			Trying to reload browser with BUILD (CTRL + 9 - incremental build) in Idea (rather than CTrl + Save) will sometimes result in WHitelabel error
